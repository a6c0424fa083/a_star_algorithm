# A\* Algorithm
A C++ implementation of the __A\* Algorithm__

##Description
As a school project I want to implement the common __A\* Algorithm__ in C++.
It will later be used to find the shortest path in images
where white pixels represent "air" and black pixels represent obstacles.
Various gray pixels are used to represent the start, end or the path.
As it is a school project I should document my progress.

##Note
This is not a working project yet. There may be some errors and
the code is not well commented right now.
