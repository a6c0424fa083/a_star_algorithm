# A\* Algorithm

A C\+\+ implementation of the __A\* Algorithm__

## Description

As a school project I want to implement the common __A\* Algorithm__ in C\+\+.<br />
It will later be used to find the shortest path in images<br />
where white pixels represent \"air\" and black pixels represent obstacles.<br />
Various gray pixels are used to represent the start, end or the path.<br />
As it is a school project I should document my progress.<br />

## Note

This is not a working project yet. There may be some errors and<br />
the code is not well commented right now.<br />
